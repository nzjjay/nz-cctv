# NZ CCTV Camera Map

This project intends to visually show the locations, purpose, and owner of public CCTV cameras across New Zealand. This serves several purposes:
- Research: There are numerous research projects underway globally around the use of CCTV. This aims to capture as many cameras used by public entities to help with data collection for research purposes. For example, you may overlay this data against crash, crime, or other data-sets to understand relationships between CCTV coverage and another factor.
- For victims of crime, this hopefully provides meaningful insight into public safety and helps liasion with Police to find evidence.
- There are many Official Information Act requests made every year to various government agencies requesting the locations of CCTV cameras, this aims to reduce these requests and free up government time on OIA requests which are high overhead.
- Principle 6 of the Privacy Act gives people the basic right to access information about themselves, including CCTV recordings. If you need to find information about yourself via CCTV, this project aims to ease that for you.
- There are many, many requests made every year to Auckland Transport requesting traffic incident footage, often in areas without CCTV coverage, which again takes up valuable council time. By viewing this map first, it may reduce these requests if there is no coverage.
- Feel safer: Knowing where cameras are hopefully provides re-assurance about the safety in the areas you are in.

The data provided is not updated frequently, and should not be relied upon as the source of truth. For the latest information, please contact your relevant council.

All data on this map is publicly sourced, either directly from Council websites, or from past Official Information Act requests from others.

## Privacy Act 2020

The placement and operation of CCTV cameras in public spaces is governed by the **[Privacy Act 2020](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0031/latest/LMS23223.html)** (NZ). Key principles relevant to public CCTV include:

- **Information Privacy Principle 1** — Agencies must only collect personal information (including imagery) for a lawful purpose connected to their functions.
- **Information Privacy Principle 3** — Where practicable, individuals should be aware they are being recorded and why.
- **Information Privacy Principle 4** — Personal information must not be collected by unlawful means or by means that intrude to an unreasonable extent on personal affairs.

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has published guidance on CCTV use: [privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/codes-of-practice/](https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/codes-of-practice/)

This project only maps **publicly disclosed** camera locations obtained through official information requests or published open data. No imagery or footage is collected or displayed.

## Contributing

CCTV camera networks exist across New Zealand — councils, NZTA, Police, and private operators all run cameras in public spaces. This map is only as complete as the data behind it.

### How to add a new data source

If you have access to publicly available camera data for a New Zealand agency (via OIA release, open data portal, or official publication):

1. **Fork this repository**
2. Add your source data and updated `docs/cameras.json`
3. Update the data sources table in this README
4. **Open a Pull Request** describing the agency, how the data was obtained, and the date of the data

### Don't have the data yet?

- **Open a Discussion** in the [Discussions tab](../../discussions) to suggest an agency or region to target with an OIA request
- **Leave a comment on an Issue** if you have partial information or want to collaborate on a request

### OIA request tips

Please do not make OIA requests if you don't have to. This wastes valuable resources of government agencies. New Zealand's **[Official Information Act 1982](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM64785.html)** gives you the right to request camera location data from government agencies. A useful template:

> *"Please provide the locations (street address or GPS coordinates) of all CCTV cameras operated by [Agency] in public spaces, including camera type and whether automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is used."*

[FYI.org.nz](https://fyi.org.nz) makes it easy to submit and track OIA requests publicly.
